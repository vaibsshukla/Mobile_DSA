### 1. How can you use a stack to handle undo operations in a mobile application?

In a mobile application, a stack is an ideal data structure to handle undo operations. A stack operates on the principle of Last In, First Out (LIFO), which makes it well-suited for undo functionalities, where the last action performed should be the first one to be undone.

Here's how you can implement undo operations using a stack in JavaScript:

##### Steps to Implement Undo with a Stack:
Initialize a Stack: Create a stack that stores actions performed by the user. Each action can be represented as an object containing the action type and any necessary state (e.g., what was changed, previous values).

1. Push Actions to the Stack: Each time the user performs an action, push the action details onto the stack. This saves the current state, which will allow you to revert it later.
2. Undo Action: When the user requests to undo an action, pop the most recent action from the stack and use its details to reverse the change.
3. Redo (Optional): If you want to implement redo, you can maintain another stack for storing undone actions, allowing the user to redo them if needed.

```js
class UndoManager {
  constructor() {
    this.undoStack = [];
    this.redoStack = []; // Optional: for redo functionality
  }

  performAction(action) {
    // Perform the action and push it to the undo stack
    this.undoStack.push(action);
    // Clear the redo stack when a new action is performed
    this.redoStack = [];
  }

  undo() {
    if (this.undoStack.length === 0) {
      console.log("Nothing to undo.");
      return;
    }

    // Get the last action from the undo stack
    const lastAction = this.undoStack.pop();
    
    // Reverse the last action
    if (lastAction.type === 'add') {
      this.removeItem(lastAction.item);
    } else if (lastAction.type === 'remove') {
      this.addItem(lastAction.item);
    }

    // Optional: Push the undone action to the redo stack
    this.redoStack.push(lastAction);
  }

  redo() {
    if (this.redoStack.length === 0) {
      console.log("Nothing to redo.");
      return;
    }

    // Get the last undone action
    const lastUndoneAction = this.redoStack.pop();
    
    // Reapply the action
    if (lastUndoneAction.type === 'add') {
      this.addItem(lastUndoneAction.item);
    } else if (lastUndoneAction.type === 'remove') {
      this.removeItem(lastUndoneAction.item);
    }

    // Push the redone action back to the undo stack
    this.undoStack.push(lastUndoneAction);
  }

  // Example item manipulations
  addItem(item) {
    console.log(`Added item: ${item}`);
  }

  removeItem(item) {
    console.log(`Removed item: ${item}`);
  }
}

// Usage:
const undoManager = new UndoManager();

// Perform actions
undoManager.performAction({ type: 'add', item: 'Item1' });
undoManager.performAction({ type: 'remove', item: 'Item2' });

// Undo the last action
undoManager.undo(); // Removes 'Item1'

// Redo the undone action
undoManager.redo(); // Adds 'Item1' back

```
#### Explanation:
1. PerformAction: Adds an action to the undo stack.
2. Undo: Pops the last action from the undo stack, reverses it, and optionally pushes it to the redo stack.
3. Redo (optional): Reapplies an undone action and moves it back to the undo stack.
4. You can adapt this approach to fit the specific operations and state management needs of your mobile app.

### 2. Describe a scenario where a queue would be useful in managing asynchronous tasks in a mobile app. 

A queue can be very useful for managing asynchronous tasks in a mobile app, especially when dealing with tasks that need to be executed in a specific order or need to be processed one at a time to avoid overwhelming system resources. Here's a scenario where a queue would be particularly beneficial:

Scenario: Handling Multiple Network Requests in a Chat Application

Problem:
Imagine a chat application where users can send and receive messages. Each time a user sends a message, the app needs to perform a series of asynchronous tasks:

Send Message: The app sends the message to the server.
Save Locally: The app saves the message locally in the device's storage.
Update UI: The app updates the UI to reflect the sent message.
Sometimes, users might send multiple messages in quick succession. If these messages are handled asynchronously without any order, it can lead to race conditions, message loss, or inconsistent UI updates.

Solution: Using a Queue
To handle this scenario effectively, a queue can be used to manage the sequence of tasks for each message. Here's how it can be implemented:

Initialize a Queue: Create a queue to manage the tasks associated with sending messages. Each entry in the queue represents a message and the tasks that need to be performed for that message.

Enqueue Tasks: When a user sends a message, enqueue the following tasks:

Send Message: Task to send the message to the server.
Save Locally: Task to save the message in local storage.
Update UI: Task to update the UI.
Process Queue: Process the tasks in the queue sequentially. Ensure that only one task per message is processed at a time. For instance, start with sending the message, then save it locally, and finally update the UI.

Handle Errors: Implement error handling for each task. If a task fails, handle the failure appropriately (e.g., retry the task, alert the user, etc.), and move on to the next task.

```js
class TaskQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = [];
    this.isProcessing = false;
  }

  enqueue(task) {
    this.queue.push(task);
    this.processQueue();
  }

  async processQueue() {
    if (this.isProcessing) return;
    this.isProcessing = true;

    while (this.queue.length > 0) {
      const currentTask = this.queue.shift();
      try {
        await currentTask();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Task failed:", error);
        // Handle error (e.g., retry, alert user)
      }
    }

    this.isProcessing = false;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const taskQueue = new TaskQueue();

function sendMessage(message) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulate sending message
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Message sent: ${message}`);
      resolve();
    }, 1000);
  });
}

function saveLocally(message) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    // Simulate saving message
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Message saved locally: ${message}`);
      resolve();
    }, 500);
  });
}

function updateUI(message) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    // Simulate UI update
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`UI updated with message: ${message}`);
      resolve();
    }, 300);
  });
}

function processMessage(message) {
  taskQueue.enqueue(async () => {
    await sendMessage(message);
    await saveLocally(message);
    await updateUI(message);
  });
}

// Simulate sending multiple messages
processMessage("Hello!");
processMessage("How are you?");
processMessage("Goodbye!");

```
Explanation:

TaskQueue Class: Manages the queue of tasks and processes them one at a time.
enqueue: Adds tasks to the queue and starts processing if not already processing.
processQueue: Processes tasks in the queue sequentially.
processMessage: Enqueues tasks associated with a single message.

Using a queue in this way ensures that each message is processed in the correct order and that the tasks associated with each message are handled sequentially, preventing potential issues with race conditions or resource conflicts.


### 3. How would you implement a priority queue for managing notifications or tasks based on priority in a mobile app ?

A Priority Queue is a useful data structure for managing tasks or notifications in a mobile app based on their priority. In a priority queue, each task is associated with a priority, and tasks with higher priority are processed before those with lower priority.

Use Case Scenario: Notification System in a Mobile App
Imagine a mobile app where notifications have different levels of importance:

Critical notifications (e.g., system alerts, urgent messages) should be displayed immediately.
Medium priority notifications (e.g., social updates) can be displayed after critical notifications.
Low priority notifications (e.g., promotional messages) can be delayed until higher-priority notifications are handled.
A priority queue would ensure that higher-priority notifications are always handled first, even if lower-priority ones are added earlier.

Steps to Implement a Priority Queue in JavaScript
Define the Priority Queue Class: Create a class that manages a queue of tasks or notifications. Each entry will have a priority associated with it.

Enqueue: When a new task or notification is added, it should be placed in the queue according to its priority.

Dequeue: The highest-priority task should be processed first.

Sort by Priority: The queue should maintain its order, ensuring the highest-priority task is always at the front.

```js
class PriorityQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = [];
  }

  // Add an item with a given priority to the queue
  enqueue(item, priority) {
    const task = { item, priority };

    // Find the correct position to insert the task based on priority
    let added = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < this.queue.length; i++) {
      if (this.queue[i].priority < task.priority) {
        this.queue.splice(i, 0, task);
        added = true;
        break;
      }
    }

    // If not added yet, append it to the end of the queue
    if (!added) {
      this.queue.push(task);
    }
  }

  // Remove and return the highest-priority item from the queue
  dequeue() {
    if (this.queue.length === 0) {
      return "Queue is empty";
    }
    return this.queue.shift().item;
  }

  // View the highest-priority item without removing it
  peek() {
    if (this.queue.length === 0) {
      return "Queue is empty";
    }
    return this.queue[0].item;
  }

  // Check if the queue is empty
  isEmpty() {
    return this.queue.length === 0;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const notificationQueue = new PriorityQueue();

// Add notifications with different priorities
notificationQueue.enqueue('Low-priority notification', 1);
notificationQueue.enqueue('Critical system alert', 5);
notificationQueue.enqueue('Social update', 3);

// Process notifications based on priority
console.log(notificationQueue.dequeue()); // "Critical system alert"
console.log(notificationQueue.dequeue()); // "Social update"
console.log(notificationQueue.dequeue()); // "Low-priority notification"

```

Explanation:
enqueue(item, priority):

Takes an item (e.g., a notification or task) and a priority value (higher values indicate higher priority).
It inserts the item at the correct position in the queue based on its priority, ensuring that higher-priority items come before lower-priority ones.
dequeue():

Removes and returns the highest-priority item (the first item in the queue).
If the queue is empty, it returns a message indicating that.
peek():

Returns the highest-priority item without removing it from the queue.
isEmpty():

Checks whether the queue is empty.
How It Works in the Mobile App:
In a notification system, notifications would be added to the priority queue based on their urgency:

Critical system alerts would have the highest priority and would be displayed first.
Social updates would have a medium priority.
Promotional messages would have the lowest priority and would only be shown after more important notifications have been handled.
The app would use enqueue() to add notifications to the queue, and dequeue() to process them in order of priority, ensuring the most important notifications are always displayed first.

Customization Options:
Dynamic Priorities: You can dynamically adjust the priority based on user interaction or app context. For example, if the app is in the foreground, certain notifications might become more important.

Task Timeouts: You can add a timeout mechanism that processes lower-priority tasks after a certain amount of time, even if higher-priority tasks are pending.

Thresholds: Implement thresholds for priority levels where, for example, tasks below a certain priority level are ignored if higher-priority tasks arrive within a given time frame.

Conclusion:
A priority queue in a mobile app allows you to manage tasks like notifications effectively, ensuring that important tasks are handled first. By using the enqueue() method to add tasks in order of priority and dequeue() to handle them, you can manage tasks or notifications in a responsive and efficient manner.


### 3. Explain how a Trie data structure can be used for efficient autocomplete functionality in a mobile app.

A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure that is highly efficient for handling operations on strings, making it an excellent choice for implementing autocomplete functionality in a mobile app. Here's how a Trie works and how it can be used for efficient autocompletion.

How a Trie Data Structure Works
A Trie is structured where:

Each node represents a single character of a string.
The root node is an empty node.
Each path down the tree represents a string, and a word is formed by traversing from the root node to the leaf node.
Each node can have multiple children, corresponding to the possible next characters.
Key Features of a Trie:
Efficient prefix matching: Trie allows efficient searching of strings that share a common prefix.
Fast lookup: Operations like insertion, deletion, and search are fast (typically O(L), where L is the length of the word).
Memory efficiency: Although it stores many words, overlapping prefixes are stored only once.
Example Structure of a Trie:
Let's say you want to store the following words in a Trie:

"car"
"cat"
"can"
"dog"
"dot"

The Trie would look like this:


           (root)
           /   \
          c     d
        / | \   / \
       a  a  a o   o
      /  /   | |   |
     r  t    n g   t

How to Use a Trie for Autocomplete
Building the Trie: Insert all possible words into the Trie. Each character of the word is added as a node, and words that share common prefixes share nodes.

Search for a Prefix: When the user types a prefix (e.g., "ca"), traverse the Trie from the root node, following the nodes that match the characters in the prefix. Once the last character of the prefix is found, all the descendant nodes form potential autocomplete suggestions.

Collect Suggestions: From the node corresponding to the last character of the prefix, perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to collect all words that are valid completions of the prefix.

Steps to Implement Autocomplete Using a Trie
Here’s how you can implement this functionality in JavaScript:

```js
class TrieNode {
  constructor() {
    this.children = {};
    this.isEndOfWord = false;  // Marks the end of a word
  }
}

class Trie {
  constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
  }

  // Insert a word into the Trie
  insert(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (let char of word) {
      if (!node.children[char]) {
        node.children[char] = new TrieNode();
      }
      node = node.children[char];
    }
    node.isEndOfWord = true;
  }

  // Search for words that start with the given prefix
  searchPrefix(prefix) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (let char of prefix) {
      if (!node.children[char]) {
        return null;  // Prefix not found
      }
      node = node.children[char];
    }
    return node;  // Return the node where the prefix ends
  }

  // Find all words with the given prefix
  autoComplete(prefix) {
    const node = this.searchPrefix(prefix);
    if (!node) {
      return [];  // No words found
    }
    const suggestions = [];
    this.dfs(node, prefix, suggestions);  // Collect all words from the prefix node
    return suggestions;
  }

  // Depth-first search (DFS) to find all words that are descendants of the current node
  dfs(node, prefix, suggestions) {
    if (node.isEndOfWord) {
      suggestions.push(prefix);
    }
    for (let char in node.children) {
      this.dfs(node.children[char], prefix + char, suggestions);
    }
  }
}

// Example usage:
const trie = new Trie();
const words = ["car", "cat", "can", "dog", "dot", "card", "care"];
words.forEach(word => trie.insert(word));

const prefix = "ca";
const suggestions = trie.autoComplete(prefix);
console.log(`Autocomplete suggestions for "${prefix}":`, suggestions);
// Output: Autocomplete suggestions for "ca": ["car", "cat", "can", "card", "care"]

```

Explanation of the Code:
TrieNode Class: Each node in the Trie has a children object (which holds references to child nodes) and a flag isEndOfWord to mark the end of a word.

Trie Class:

insert(): Adds a word to the Trie by creating nodes for each character.
searchPrefix(): Searches for a given prefix in the Trie and returns the node where the prefix ends.
autoComplete(): Finds all possible words that complete the given prefix by calling the DFS method.
dfs(): Recursively explores the Trie starting from the node where the prefix ends, collecting all valid words.
Usage:

The words "car", "cat", "can", "dog", "dot", etc., are inserted into the Trie.
When the user types "ca", the autoComplete() function searches for all words starting with "ca", returning suggestions like "car", "cat", "can", "card", and "care".
Benefits of Using a Trie for Autocomplete:
Efficient Prefix Search: The Trie enables efficient lookup of words starting with a given prefix, typically in O(L), where L is the length of the prefix. This is faster than searching through an unsorted list of words.

Scalability: A Trie can store a large number of words and allows quick access to them, making it ideal for autocompletion in apps that deal with large vocabularies or datasets (e.g., messaging apps, search engines).

Memory Efficiency: Words with shared prefixes are stored compactly, minimizing the overall memory footprint. This is especially important in mobile applications with limited resources.

Optimizations and Variations:
Weighted Trie: Assign weights to each word in the Trie based on frequency or user preferences. This allows the app to suggest more relevant or commonly used words first.

Limit Suggestions: In mobile apps, limit the number of suggestions (e.g., only show the top 5 results) for a better user experience.

Predictive Text: Combine a Trie with machine learning or statistical models to improve prediction accuracy by analyzing the user's typing patterns or previous queries.

Conclusion:
A Trie is a powerful data structure for implementing efficient autocomplete functionality in a mobile app. It allows you to quickly find all words that match a given prefix and scale the autocomplete feature for large datasets, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience.
